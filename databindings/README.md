## What is it?
Databindings is a Red Dead Redemption native technology to add some data in "containers".

## Why use it?
They are used for interfaces, in huds, notifications, menus and so on...

## We can separate interfaces into 3 main categories:
- [hud contexts](hudcontexts)
- [uiapps](uiapps)
- [the rest](other)
